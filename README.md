# English-Alphabet-Cheker
"A simple C++ program that checks whether the user has entered all the letters of the English alphabet and displays missing letters or letter frequencies."
# Features   
- Converts all input letters to lowercase for consistency.  
- Counts the occurrences of each letter.  
- Notifies the user if they have entered all 26 letters.  
- Displays missing letters if the input is incomplete.  
- Asks the user whether they want to see the frequency of each letter.  

# How It Works   
1. The user inputs a string.  
2. The program processes the string and counts letter occurrences.  
3. If all letters (A-Z) are present, it congratulates the user.  
4. If some letters are missing, it displays them.  
5. The user can choose to see the frequency of each letter.
